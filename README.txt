This is version 2.0 of a web portal for HUT EPS classes 2003-2008.

The first version is not available (physically) as the author was too ashamed to
keep it in his computer :) and the second one was developed from scratch in
around 2005-2006.

The portal was designed for a purpose of keeping students together and be
updated with news and grades from the faculty. Additionally, itself created lots
of fun for the author programming it.

Having said that, the open forum, which stayed along with this, also put some
members, who strongly believed in the right of free speech, in trouble. :)
So sorry for them.

In term of programming, the portal contains some trending technologies during
that time though they are standard now, such as AJAX, DB driver, BBCODE,
CAPTCHA, Smarty, native utf-8 and multi-language support. But what the author
was really proud of is that the website was compatible with both FF 1.5 and IE
6.0 - a pain in the ass.
